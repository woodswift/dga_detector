The docker image can be found at:
https://hub.docker.com/r/woodswift/dgaclf

The docker pull command is:
docker pull woodswift/dgaclf:v0.0.1

After the pull operation is completed, run "docker image ls" to check whether
the pull operation is successful.

To start the micro-service, you can run:

docker run -p 4000:4000 woodswift/dgaclf:v0.0.1

To check how the micro-service, open a web browser or Postman first.

(1) Example 1: www1.undefinedratiotanks.nrw
Enter "http://localhost:4000/predict?domain=www1.undefinedratiotanks.nrw", and
then the following result is shown:

{
    "domain": "www1.undefinedratiotanks.nrw",
    "label": "dga",
    "probability_to_be_dga": "0.99978226",
    "success": true
}

"domain" stores the input domain name;
"label" stores the predicted class (dga or legit);
"probability_to_be_dga" stores the probability that the input domain name is a
dga from the model;
"success" stores whether the model makes prediction for the input domain name
sccuessfully (true or false);

(2) Example 2: iraq-live.com
Enter "http://localhost:4000/predict?domain=iraq-live.com", and
then the following result is shown:

{
    "domain": "iraq-live.com",
    "label": "legit",
    "probability_to_be_dga": "5.228832e-07",
    "success": true
}

Hit CTRL+C in the terminal to quit.

When a collection of domain names need to be predicted by the micro-service,
please refer to the script test_api.py and the example inside.

If tensorflow, keras, numpy and flask have been installed already, the micro-
service can be also started by running:

python app.py
